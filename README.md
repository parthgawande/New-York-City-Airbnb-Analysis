## 📊 Key Visualizations
- **Rental Price Heatmap**: A heatmap showing the distribution of Airbnb rental prices across different neighborhoods in NYC.
- **Borough-wise Listings**: Bar charts representing the number of Airbnb listings per borough.
- **Availability Trends**: Line graphs indicating rental availability trends over the course of a year.
- **Top Hosts and Superhosts**: A ranked list of the top hosts in NYC based on the number of listings and reviews.

## 📋 Dataset Information
The dataset for this project was sourced from Airbnb’s open data, covering detailed information about hosts, listings, and user reviews. The data includes:
- Listing ID, host ID, and room type
- Geographical coordinates (latitude, longitude)
- Number of reviews, price, and availability for the next 365 days

## 🚀 Cloud Setup & Querying Process
The dataset was stored and queried using **Google BigQuery**. This allowed for efficient handling and querying of large datasets directly on the cloud, minimizing the need for local resources.
- Queries were run on the BigQuery engine, which allowed for fast data extraction and analysis.
- The data was visualized using Python-based visualization libraries and Tableau for an interactive experience.
